This program lets you create various groups of feeds for web-comics, tumblr-pages, youtube-channels (without a google-account), rss-feeds in general and mangarock-pages per default. 
In the future, this software should also be able to give the user the possibilty to generate feeds from webpages, that don't have any direct rss-functionalities.
